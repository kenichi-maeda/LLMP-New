Next, divide each value in the list by the largest value, so that the largest value becomes 1.0. Now, look at the bar chart again. Identify the largest bar, which is marked with a dot. Move left to right along the bar chart starting from the largest bar, estimating the ratio of the other four values to the maximum. Format your answer as [1.0, x.x, x.x, x.x, x.x].",
